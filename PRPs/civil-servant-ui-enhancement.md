name: "Civil Servant UI Enhancement - Match Gov-Emp Design Pattern"
description: |

## Purpose
Enhance civil-servant.html UI to match the professional design pattern of gov-emp.html while preserving the civil servant calculation logic from examples/new-salary-2025. Create a consistent user experience across the Thai Government Salary System.

## Core Principles
1. **Design Consistency**: Mirror gov-emp.html UI design exactly for professional government appearance
2. **Logic Preservation**: Keep civil servant calculation functionality from examples/new-salary-2025
3. **Thai Government Standards**: Maintain formal Thai language and government styling
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile compatibility for government employees
5. **Institution Type Integration**: Seamlessly integrate radio button functionality into the design pattern

---

## Goal
Transform civil-servant.html from basic Bootstrap form to professional government UI matching gov-emp.html design patterns while maintaining civil servant-specific calculation logic and institution type filtering.

## Why
- **Professional Appearance**: Government employees expect consistent, professional interfaces
- **User Experience**: Unified design reduces training and confusion across different calculators
- **Brand Consistency**: Maintains government system visual identity standards
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Government staff need reliable mobile access to salary calculations
- **Institutional Requirements**: Civil servant calculations require institution type filtering not present in gov-emp

## What
Transform civil-servant.html UI to match gov-emp.html design while preserving civil servant calculation logic:

### Success Criteria
- [ ] UI design matches gov-emp.html exactly (hero section, form cards, result cards)
- [ ] Institution type radio buttons integrated seamlessly into form design
- [ ] Civil servant calculation logic preserved with 823 salary records
- [ ] 6-section result display maintains professional appearance
- [ ] Responsive design works on all government devices
- [ ] Thai language consistency with formal government terminology
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- [ ] No Select2 dependencies - native elements only

### Known Gotchas of Thai Government System & UI Patterns
```javascript
// CRITICAL: gov-emp.html UI patterns that must be preserved
// - Hero section with gradient background and centered content
// - Two-column layout: form card (left) + result card (right)
// - Sticky result card behavior on desktop
// - Lucide icons for all form fields and sections
// - Professional color scheme: indigo/blue/gray palette
// - Border-radius and shadow consistency for cards
// - Form validation styling and error states
// - Thai typography and font loading

// CIVIL SERVANT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
// - Institution type radio buttons must integrate into form design
// - 6-section result display (not 3-section like gov-emp)
// - Dynamic qualification loading based on institution selection
// - 823 salary records with domestic/foreign filtering
// - Professional government terminology in Thai

// TECHNICAL GOTCHAS
// - No jQuery/Select2 dependencies - use native elements
// - Tailwind CSS classes must match gov-emp.html exactly
// - Component loading timing with Vite module system
// - Responsive breakpoints for mobile government users
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data Models and Structure

Civil servant UI must handle institution-filtered data while maintaining gov-emp visual patterns.
```javascript
// Institution filtering integration with professional UI
const institutionTypes = [
  { value: 'ในประเทศ', label: 'สถานศึกษาในประเทศ', count: 586 },
  { value: 'ต่างประเทศ', label: 'สถานศึกษาต่างประเทศ', count: 237 }
];

// Result display must show 6 sections in professional card format
const resultSections = [
  'ผลการคำนวณ',
  'จำนวนเงินที่ได้ปรับ', 
  'อัตราเงินเดือนที่ได้รับ',
  'รายละเอียดการคำนวณ',
  'วิธีการคำนวณ',
  'หลักเกณฑ์และเงื่อนไข'
];
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Thai Government Context)
- ❌ Don't deviate from gov-emp.html design patterns - maintain exact visual consistency
- ❌ Don't compromise calculation accuracy for visual enhancements
- ❌ Don't break institution type filtering functionality
- ❌ Don't ignore mobile responsiveness - many government staff use phones
- ❌ Don't add unnecessary animations that slow older government computers
- ❌ Don't use informal UI elements - maintain professional government appearance
- ❌ Don't hardcode Thai text - maintain data-driven content approach
- ❌ Don't skip cross-browser testing - government systems vary widely
- ❌ Don't modify existing calculation logic without thorough validation
- ❌ Don't introduce new dependencies - keep system lightweight and reliable

## Thai Government Specific Considerations
- UI must convey professional government authority and trustworthiness
- Visual hierarchy must guide users through complex salary calculations
- Error states must be clear and helpful in formal Thai language  
- Loading states must provide feedback for slower government networks
- Print functionality should work for official documentation
- Color contrast must meet accessibility standards for all users
- Touch targets must be sized appropriately for mobile government workers
- Institution type selection must be prominent and clear for accurate calculations
